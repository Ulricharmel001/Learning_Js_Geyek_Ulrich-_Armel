# Introduction to JavaScript  

This repo is just me sharing my learning progress with JavaScript basics.  

So far, Iâ€™ve explored:  
- Data types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `bigint`, `undefined`, `null`, and `symbol`.  
- Different kinds of loops: `while`, `for`, and nested loops.  
- The use of `switch` statements.  

Each topic was backed up with hands-on exercises to help me practice and understand the concepts better.
